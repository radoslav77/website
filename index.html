		<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
		Hello there, I have been a Pastry Chef for over twenty-three years. 
		And really-really enjoyed it. I am very passionate and creative, 
		a self-driven person in constant outlook to develop myself. 
		The important things for me in a dish is a test, colour combination, presentation and seasonality,
		as you would imagine the best products are in their prime when in season and I like to compliment the flavours so that the result is a masterpiece worth a million.
		Working in several iconic 5 stars London hotels 
		I have built extensive experience and expertise which I put in action day in and day out. 
		From fine dining to events and corporate conference all of my creations are made with only one thing in mind - 
		how to indulge my customers as there is no bigger satisfaction than seeing my customers happy and appreciative of the job I have done. 
		Please have a browse thru my webpages to get a feel of your own. 

 <br><strong>Many Thanks</strong><br><strong>Rado</strong>
